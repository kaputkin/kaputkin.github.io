The home run is a celebrity in the baseball stats world. Home runs get replayed and analysts talk about their distance and launch angles. No surprise then that there are a plethora of home run related records kept, from the basics (home runs in a season, home runs in a career) to the not-so-basic (consecutive home runs in a single game, consecutive home runs in consecutive games...).

No one ever talks about the quickness in which home runs are hit, however. Not the exit velocity, but literally, how quickly are players hitting home runs? How much time elapses between a players individual home runs? In other words, who is the King of Home Run Quickness?   

Since 2010, the MLB has kept timestamps on a pitch-by-pitch basis, allowing for precise calculation in time between home runs. It is difficult then, to figure out this speed record between two home runs. Only 59 players have homered twice in one inning, dating back to 1880. Most recently, Trea Turner hit two homers in the top of the 8th (against the same pitcher) in just a 15-minute span. Hard to imagine batting through the line up quicker than that. 

But what about the speed record for three? We can make some better assumptions based on the innings here. No one has ever hit three home runs in a single inning, so we can assume the record goes to someone who hit two in one inning and one in an adjacent inning.

On July 23rd, 2002, Nomar Garciappara hit three home runs over two innings. It was also his birthday. By hitting two in the third, and one in the fourth, he likely set the record for the quickest span to hit three home runs. In the half inning between his second and third homers, Tim Wakefield pitched an eleven pitch, one-two-three inning, keeping things quick. Because this was not in the time-stamped pitch stats era, until I find a recorded broadcast of that game, I can only guess that Nomar's three homers took place in less than 50 minutes. Interestingly, even though 26 runs were scored in this game, the game time was only 2 hours 40 minutes.

Who can compare to that since 2010? Five players have hit three home runs in less than an hour, but none less than 50 minutes.

|Player  |Date | 3-HR Time |
|--|--|--|
| Manny Machado | August 7, 2016| 53 minutes 	|
| Adrian Beltre | August 23, 2012 | 53 minutes	|
| Scooter Gennett | June 7, 2017 | 56 minutes	|
| Aristides Aquino |August 10, 2019  |57 minutes |
| Mookie Betts | August 14, 2020 | 58 minutes|

The stand out here is actually Scooter Gennett, who had a solid career, but was never known as a power hitter. Fans who were paying attention may have been dissapointed Gennett's three-home runs in 56 minutes was three minutes shy of the record, but he was just pacing himself, apparently. In his next at bat, 36 minutes later, he launched his fourth home run of the night, etching his name stat savant history. Not only becoming the 18th ever player to hit four home runs in a single game, but doing in a record one hour and 32 minutes.

Incluing Scooter, three players have hit 4 homers in a game since 2010. Forty-four have hit four home runs in 24 hours or less, but between two games on different days.

| Scooter Gennett | August 7, 2016| 1 hour 32 minutes |
| JD Martinez | August 23, 2012 | 1 hour 55 minutes	|
| Josh Hamilton | June 7, 2017 | 2 hours 13 minutes	|

Fun stats, but why not stop there? No player has ever hit five home runs in a single game. Plenty have hit five over two games though, so who has done it the quickest? 

On May 19th, 2001, Barry Bonds blasted three homers in a game that began at 8pm in Atlanta with his first coming in third inning. The next day, he launched two more before that game ended at 5pm, giving him a total of 5 what I guess is right around 18 hours. Again, with no pitch timestamps in the official stats, we can't know for sure. 

Yasiel Puig is only player since then to come close to this. Between a night game on September 14th, 2018 and a noon game the following day, Puig hit five homers in 19 hours and 27 minutes. 

|Player  |Date | 5-HR Time |
|--|--|--|
| Yasiel Puig | August 7, 2016| 19 hours 27 minutes |
| Kyle Schwarber | August 23, 2012 | 20 hours 55 minutes |
| Mookie Betts | June 7, 2017 | 24 hours 43 minutes	|
| Jose Abreu | June 7, 2017 | 26 hours 28 minutes |
| Matt Carpenter | June 7, 2017 | 31 hours 9 minutes |

Still, I think the most impressive streak is Shawn Green's seven home runs over three days in 2002 which began with a four home run game on May 23rd, a solo shot the next day, and two more on the 25th. Let's just go ahead and assume that's the speed record for seven.
